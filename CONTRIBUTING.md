# Contributing to psm-tools
We value your input. We want to make contributing to psm-tools as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the only way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Always update associated documentation if it changes how someone will use the code/feature.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue your pull request back to `develop` in our repo

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/pensando/psm-tools/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. We're not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
If all else fails, use the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) as a guideline
